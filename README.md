# Classification Experiments 🔍📚

A repository dedicated to exploring and comparing classification algorithms across various datasets. It includes hands-on experiments with preprocessing techniques, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualization of results — perfect for learners and practitioners diving deep into supervised learning.

## 🚀 Overview

**Classification_Exp** is a learning-oriented project where different machine learning classifiers are implemented, tested, and evaluated systematically. It is ideal for understanding the behavior, performance, and use cases of models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, and more.

## 🧠 Features

- 🧪 Comparative experiments with multiple classification algorithms
- ⚖️ Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.
- 🔍 Visualizations using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance plots
- 📁 Modular code design for reuse and testing
- 💡 Includes preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning examples

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
